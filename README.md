# js_not_work_in_htmlunit2.27
There was an issue in 2017 with htmlunit browser and htmlunitdriver that JavaScript scripts didn't work on htmlunit at some cases.

Here you can find the simple test and it sources to reproduce the bug in [1.0 tag](https://github.com/aleksandr-kotlyar/js_not_work_in_htmlunit2.27/releases/tag/1.0).

May be today this issue has gone in new versions of htmlunit.
