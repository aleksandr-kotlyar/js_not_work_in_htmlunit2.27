# js_not_work_in_htmlunit2.27
There was an issue in 2017 with htmlunit browser and htmlunitdriver that JavaScript scripts didn't work on htmlunit at some cases.

To reproduce the bug download sources from [1.0 tag](https://github.com/aleksandr-kotlyar/js_not_work_in_htmlunit2.27/releases/tag/1.0).

May be today this issue has gone in new versions of htmlunit.
